HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building fast,
robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.

This project is the product of many years of iterative development and combined
community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development philosophy or
framework, so you're free to architect your code in the way that you want.
